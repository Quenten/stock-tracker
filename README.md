# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Introduction

Welcome to your React + TypeScript + Vite project. If you've never done any coding before, don't worry. This guide will walk you through the basic steps to get your project running, even if you're completely new to development.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to start your coding journey:

1. **Install Node.js**

- Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS version.
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set Up the Project**

- Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.
- Navigate to your project folder. For example:
  ```
  cd /Users/quenten.brouwer/IKEA/stock-tracker
  ```
- Install the project dependencies by running:
  ```
  npm install
  ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

- Start the development server with the following command:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
- Open your web browser and go to the URL shown in the Terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

4. **Begin Coding**

- Open the project in your favorite code editor.
- As you make changes, the development server will automatically update your application so you can see your changes in real time.
